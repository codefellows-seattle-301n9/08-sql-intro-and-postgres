# Lab 08 SQL Intro and Postgres

**Author**: Nick - Dennis (has the working finished lab)
**Version**: 1.0 


## Overview
This application is designed to allow the user to set up a client/server function which allows connection from view to controller and from controller to model and return. We are building this to be able to retrieve the article data from a database instead of from a file that is provided.

## Getting Started
1. The user must install the NPM and PostgresSQL packages on their computer
2. Possibly edit username/password to connect the client to a database
3. Install the dependencies


## Architecture
1. The user must install the following json packages - npm express, body-parser and pg.
2. Installed nodemon

## Change Log
Changes from lab 7 to lab 8
1. We added the ability to connect to a postgres data base
